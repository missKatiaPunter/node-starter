// Task A02
// Design a suitable, single SQL ‘CREATE TABLE’ instruction that results
// in the creation (IF NOT EXISTS) of the ‘Messages’ table as illustrated in the AdaBoard schema;
// don’t forget to include the Primary Key and Foreign Key constraint - ensure your FK cascades any user table deletes.
// Repeat the setup for “CURRENT_TIMESTAMP” as outlined in the previous requirement.
